<!-- 
	* This is the referenced bizySoftConfig file that can be used for shared environments where the PHP include_path is difficult
	* to change. You should change the above dtd and the <referencedConfigFile> to suit your installation. In a run time environment 
	* this file would normally be named bizySoftConfig.xml or yourDomainName.xml. (e.g. yourdomain.com.xml).
	*
	* In shared environments, PHP is usually configured with an include_path containing "." which in most cases is your PHP DOCUMENT_ROOT 
	* (usually the public_html or www directory). The webserver only has access to files under your DOCUMENT_ROOT. 
	
	* Note that "." actually means the directory that the PHP script you call resides in, so access to the bizySoft directory needs 
	* to be from PHP files directly in your DOCUMENT_ROOT (the disadvantage to using this technique).
	*
	* Your DOCUMENT_ROOT resides in your website's 'account home directory'. The webserver does not have access to this directory, 
	* so files cannot be served from there. To keep your config safe, it's recommended to put your config file(s) somewhere under 
	* your 'account home directory' but outside your DOCUMENT_ROOT, then you can load it with the <referencedConfigFile> tag.
	*
	* This makes it possible to install the bizySoft directory into your DOCUMENT_ROOT, but load your sensitive XML 
	* config information from a file that cannot be served by your webserver.
	*
	* This file will load the <referencedConfigFile> file which should contain all your database config.
